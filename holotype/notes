Scap A (at the Dinosaur Journey Paleontological Museum in Fruita, Colorado)
Left scap
Maybe 8 feet long (2.44 m), based on me as scalebar

Scap B (at the North American Museum of Ancient Life in Lehi, Utah)
Right scap
Maybe BYU 9025, based on Lovelace et al. (2008:figure 10) caption
Maybe 2.34 m long (7 feet 8 inches), based on Lovelace et al. (2008:figure 10) scalebar

"A shoulder blade, still partially encased in clay, spanned eight feet" (George 1973b) suggests the eight-feet-long specimen may have become to holotype, though it might not have.

Jensen 1985 designated BYU 5500 (= BYU 9025) as the holotype and it was 2.44 m (8') long.

He referred BYU 5501 (= BYU 12962) and said it was 8'10" long -- but neither scap in its present form seems to be longer than 8'.

Jensen 1987 says "One of these (BYU 5500, Fig. 9B) is the holotype of Supersaurus vivianae" and fig 9b shows Scap A.

Curtice and Stadtman (2002) noted that BYU 9025 is a left scap and BYU 12962 is a right scap.

Curtice and Stadtman (2002:39) said "Stripping away the paint and resin on BYU 9025 revealed the proximal end had been inadvertently lengthened during preservation. Close examination of the actual bone surface nets a total scapulocoracoid length less than 50 mm longer than BYU 12962." That suggests that the holotype was longer, but we know from Jensen 1985 that the opposite was the case.

McInnes reduced the length of "second specimen" to 8'10 but that is still ten inches longer than either scap appears to be.
