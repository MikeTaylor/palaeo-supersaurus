These letters were sent from Jim Jensen to preparator Dale McInnes in
the 1970s, and were scanned and sent to me by McInnes on Monday 10
August 2020.

These were sent as a followup to [McInnes's SV-POW! comment](https://svpow.com/2020/08/04/john-conways-brontosmash/#comment-218297):

> Hello Mike … I have the Jensen papers from 1973-79. Most were personal. But I have 3 here that might interest U. I can download them but to where?? I don’t think these R going to B of much help but they R historical somewhat. I visited him at that time and he reciprocated by coming up here for a while. Those were heady days around a table with Jack McIntosh, John Ostrom, Charlie Sternberg …. But I digress. I still have photos to go through. Phil and I discussed the idea of pouring resin into the impression in the matrix (that extra 10″) since the impression was so obvious. Most of that extra resin would have appeared odd to most. We should have placed some text with it to explain why we did it. Never thought at the time that anyone would “monkey” around with the original B 4 contacting us and at least asking why. One of the letters’ also point out the same lack of caution in the field by assuming too much trust in future generations. Charlie S. also talked about a similar incident that happened to him (pers. comm.).
